## The Only Traffic Loop You Need

1. Create one money page  
2. Distribute it in 2–3 places  
3. Engage with replies  
4. Improve the page  
5. Repeat  

Everything else is noise.

## Platform Selection (Pick Two)

Choose based on where your audience already is.

| Platform | Best For | Effort |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Reddit | Honest problem-solving | Medium |
| Twitter / X | Thought leadership | Medium |
| Hacker News | Technical content | High |
| LinkedIn | Professional niches | Low-Medium |
| YouTube Shorts | Broad reach | Medium |
| TikTok | Fast testing | Medium |

Do not use more than two.
